        "\n",
        "\n",
        "Ans: The yield statement suspends function’s execution and sends a value back to the caller, but retains enough state to enable function to resume where it is left off. When resumed, the function continues execution immediately after the last yield run. This allows its code to produce a series of values over time, rather than computing them at once and sending them back like a list."

        "\n",
        "Ans:List comprehension is more concise and easier to read as compared to map. List comprehension are used when a list of results is required as map only returns a map object and does not return any list. Map is faster in case of calling an already defined function (as no lambda is required)."
